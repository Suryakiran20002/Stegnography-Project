# Stegnography-Project
. The steganography project in C hides secret messages within images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. It enables users to embed and extract messages from image files, featuring file I/O operations, a command-line interface, and error handling for robust functionality
Creating a steganography project in C can be a fun and educational experience. Here's a simple outline for a basic steganography program that hides text messages in BMP image files. This example focuses on hiding the message in the least significant bits (LSBs) of the pixel data.

Project Outline
Project Setup:

Create a new C project folder.
Include necessary header files (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h).
BMP File Structure:

Understand the BMP file format, specifically the header and pixel data.
Functions:

Load BMP: Read the BMP file and extract pixel data.
Hide Message: Modify the pixel data to include the hidden message.
Save BMP: Write the modified pixel data back to a new BMP file.
Extract Message: Read the pixel data from a BMP file to retrieve the hidden message.
Main Function:

Implement user options to either hide a message or extract a message.

Key Points to Implement
Loading BMP: Read the BMP file, including its headers and pixel data.
Hiding a Message: For each character in the message, modify the least significant bit of the pixel's color values.
Extracting a Message: Read the least significant bits of the pixel data to reconstruct the hidden message.
File I/O: Ensure proper handling of BMP file reading and writing.
Additional Considerations
Error Handling: Add checks for file opening, memory allocation, etc.
Message Length: Implement checks for the message length versus the available pixel data.
User Interface: You can enhance the user interface for better usability.
The steganography project in C allows users to embed and extract secret messages in images via command-line arguments. To embed a message, use:

bash
Copy code
./a.out -e beautiful.bmp secret.txt stego.bmp
Here, -e specifies the embedding mode, beautiful.bmp is the carrier image, secret.txt contains the message, and stego.bmp is the output image with the hidden message.

To extract the message, use:

bash
Copy code
./a.out -d stego.bmp output.txt
In this command, -d denotes the decoding mode, stego.bmp is the image containing the hidden message, and output.txt is where the extracted message will be saved. This project effectively demonstrates data hiding techniques and file manipulation in C.
